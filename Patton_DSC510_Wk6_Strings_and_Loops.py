# The purpose of this weekâ€™s assignment is to demonstrate the use of strings and loops in a Python program.
# This week we will create a program which works with lists. Your goal is to create a program which contains a list of
# temperatures. Your program will populate the list by prompting the user to input temperatures. Your program will
# determine the number of temperatures entered by the user and stored in the list, determine the largest temperature
# in the list, and the smallest temperature in the list.

# Your program must have the following elements:
# A header.
# Try blocks where appropriate to prevent unhandled exceptions.
# A Main method.
# An empty list called temperatures.
# Allow the user to input a series of temperatures along with a sentinel value which will stop the user input.
# Evaluate the temperatures in the temperatures list to determine the largest and smallest temperature.
# Print the largest temperature in a legible format.
# Print the smallest temperature in a legible format.
# Print a message that tells the user how many temperatures are in the list.
# Must have good coding practices.
